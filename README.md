## HelloArduino

### Description & Code
The goal of this project was to learn how to use an arduino editor to create basic patterns for an arduino uno to follow.
I learned to make an LED blink, and make the serial monitor display words at specific times.
This is my code with comments to explain what each part does:
```C++
// Wes Swanson
// Hello arduino
/* This makes an LED blink twice a second and prints the word blink twice a 
second. It writes "Hello" in the void setup before it starts.
*/
void setup() // This happens once, turns on the Arduino Uno before void loop starts.
{
 pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // This sets pin 13 to be an output
 Serial.begin(9600); // This turns on the serial moneter
 Serial.println("Hello"); // writes the word hello
}
void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // turns pin 13 on
  Serial.println("Blink"); // writes the word blink
  delay(250); // Delay 1/4 second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW); // turns pin 13 off
  delay(250); // Delay 1/4 second
} // End of loop, starts over again
```

### Reflection
This project taught me a lot about circuits, LEDs, the Arduino Uno, and the code to control it all. Here are some important things I will need to know in the future:
When wiring the LED:
* Put LEDs the right direction (long side goes on the positive end).
* use a resistor for the LEDs.
* put the positive end into pin 13 if you are using this code, and put the negative end into ground.

When writing the code it is important to know these definitions:
* Pinmode() sets a pin to input or output.
* Serial.begin() turns on the serial monitor.
* Serial.println() prints a line of text on the serial monitor.
* pinmode() turns a pin's output either on or off depending if you write "high" or "low",
* delay() sets a delay time before the next action (this is needed to prevent it from crashing).

Also, you will need to know:
* Put a semicolen after each line of code.
* Put two slashes before a line of text or a slash and a star before and after multiple lines of code.
* Make sure there is a bracket before and after the code in the void setup and the void loop.

## FiniteLEDBlink

### Description & Code

This assignment was to make an LED blink five times and than stop. I used the code from the assignment above and added more code to make three LEDs blink five times each and then stop. Here is my code with descriptions for what it does:
```C++
// Wes Swanson
// 11/18/20
// finite LED blink
/* This makes three LEDs blink in turn for 1/4 second with 1/4 second between each blink. Each time
  an LED turns on, the serial monitor will display the pin that is blinking (13, 12, or 11) and the
  work "Blink". It will also count up from 0 the number of times that LED has blinked. after blinking
  5 times each, the loop will stop.
*/
int led = 13;
int W = 0; 
/* These functions creates variables that are always an integer (that is why int is written
  before the variable). The number sets that variable to an initial value before they possibly change
  later in the code.
*/
void setup()
{
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT); // This sets pin led to be an output pin.
  pinMode((led - 1), OUTPUT); // This sets pin led-1 to be an output pin.
  // Because led is set to pin 13, led-1 is pin 12.
  pinMode((led - 2), OUTPUT); // This sets pin led-2 to be an output pin.
  // Because led is set to pin 13, led-2 is pin 11.
  Serial.begin(9600); // This turns on the serial moneter.
  Serial.println("Hello"); // This writes the word hello.
}
void loop()
{
  if (W < 5) { // This line says that everything below happens only if W is less than five.
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
    Serial.print(led); // writes the value of led at that time (it could be 13, 12, or 11).
    Serial.print(" Blink \t"); // writes the word blink and creates a space (like the tab key)
    Serial.println(W); // writes the value of W at that time (it could be 0 through 4)
    delay(250);
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);
    delay(250); //
    led = led - 1; // sets the value of the variable led one lower.
    if (led == 10) {
      /* this is a conditional statement. == means that the computer should check to see
        if led is equal to ten. If it is, the code below will happen, if not, it will jump to the end of
        the loop and start over again.*/
      led = 13; // this sets led back to 13 again.
      W = W + 1;
      /* this makes the value of W (the variable that counts the number of times each led
        has blinked) go up 1. This is part of the conditional statement so it happens every three
        times this loop is run. */
    }
  }
} // End of loop, starts over again
```

### Reflection

This assignment taught me about variables and "if" statements, and I used those as well as my knowledge from the previous assignment to create a very cool project. It is very important to define your variables correctly and use capitalization correctly when using variables. It is also important to use "If" statements correctly. Remember:
* Start with the word if, then a space.
* in parentheses, write the statement such as (x>4).
* If you want the computer to find out whether something is equal to something, rather than making it equal, use double equal signs, like if (y == 1).
* After the parentheses, write what should happen if your if statement is true inside brackets like this: {digitalWrite (9, HIGH)}

As I learn to edit this code, it's getting more fun because I can do so many more things. I'm excited to learn more about this topic.

## VariableLEDBlink

### Description & Code
This assignment was to make an LED blink on for 1 seconds, off for 1 seconds and then on for 0.9 seconds and off for 0.8 seconds and so on until it got down to 0 seconds when it would go back up to 1 seconds. I created that project, but then added some code to make it use 3 LEDs instead of one. It will also print the delay time and the LED that's blinking every time one turns on. Here is my code that I wrote:
```C++
/* Wes Swanson
  11/20/20
  Variable LED Blinker
  This code makes three LEDs in pins 13, 12, and 11. Each one blinks for 1 seconds with 1 seconds in between before the delay time is lowered to
  0.9 seconds and then 0.8 seconds and so on. When it reaches zero delay time it will jump back up to 1 seconds of delay time. The serial
  monitor will display the LED that is blinking as well as the current delay time when each LED turns on.
*/
int LED = 13; //This variable is the LED that is on. It starts at 13 but will also be 12 and 11.
int delayvar = 1000; //This variable is the delay time during and between when each LED blinks.

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin (9600);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.print(LED);
  Serial.print("\t"); // This prints a space between the value of LED and the value of delayvar the size of the tab key.
  Serial.print(delayvar);
  Serial.print("\n"); // This starts a new line on the serial monitor.
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(delayvar);
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(delayvar);
  LED = LED - 1;
  if (LED == 10) { // the == makes the computer check if LED = 10. If it is, the folowing things will happen.
    LED = 13;
    delayvar = delayvar - 100;
  }
  if (delayvar == 0) { // Here is another if statement that makes delayvar go back up to 1000 when it reaches 0.
    delayvar = 1000;
  }
}

```

### Image or Wiring

This project uses the same wiring as the finite LED blinker:

![image](https://github.com/Wesswanson/BasicArduino-1/blob/main/Screenshot%202020-11-23%20at%204.28.44%20PM.png?raw=true)

### Reflection

This project didn't use many things that weren't in the finite LED blink project, but it gave me more practice writing code and using variables and if statements. The code above has two variables: delavar which is the delay time, and LED which is the LED that is blinking (13, 12 or 11). It also had two if statements, one to make the LED value go up from 11 to 13, and one to make delayvar go up from 100 to 1000. You should only need to use one variable and one if statement with one LED blinking.
One important thing I learned while doing this was how to create new lines and spaces on the serial monitor. I don't know if this is the most efficient way because I just looked it up using articles from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/), but these are some things I learned and used:
* serial.println(\t) will create a space the size of the tab key. You can also write it as: serial.print("\t"), but that won't be on it's own line.
* serial.print("\n") will create a new line on the serial monitor.

When writing your code, remember to be very clear with your writing and remember to use capitalization right especially when using variables. You can use the auto indent feature if you are using the arduino create editor.

# ButtonActivatedLED

### Description & Code

This assignment was to make an LED light up when you push a button. I made one version that turnes on the light when the button is pushed in, and one where the button toggles the LED. This is my first piece of code, that will light up an LED connected to pin 2 when the button is pressed and pin 12 receives an input.

```C++
/*
Wes Swanson
11/27/20
Button Activated LED
This code Makes an LED blink when you hold down a button.
*/
int ledPin = 2;  // variable for the LED connected to digital pin 2
int inPin = 12;    // variable for the pushbutton connected to digital pin 12
int val = 0;      // variable to store the read value

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);  // sets the digital pin 2 as output
  pinMode(inPin, INPUT);    // sets the digital pin 12 as input
}

void loop() {
  val = digitalRead(inPin);   // reads the input pin
  if (val == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    delay(250);
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    delay(250);
  }
}
```

### Reflection

This part of the assignment didn't involve too many more skills in terms of the coding, but I did learn a lot about how the buttons work and how to wire up a button and an LED. You can see in my image above that they are in two separate circuits, which makes sense now that I am thinking about it, but last week I thought the button and the lED would have to be connected somehow in order to work. The 5 volts pin is always sending electricity through the button and back to ground, but when the button is pressed it allows electricity to the other side where there is another wire connected to pin 12. This pin is set to "input" during the setup process of the code, so it is used to tell whether the button has been pushed.
I did learn how to use "digitalRead()" to read the input of pin 12 in this assignment. Remember these things when trying to read the input level of a pin:
* Write it correctly and write the pin or variable inside the parentheses after digitalRead.
* set the value that is read equal to a variable such as val in my code
* Use that variable to eather print the value (serial.Print(val) or use it in an If statement (if (val == HIGH)...)

Also remember to put the button in the right way. I had trouble while working on this and I thought my code was wrong, but really my wiring was messed up.

# ButtonToggledLED

### Description & Code

This was the same assignment, but I learned some new skills that I'll talk about in the reflection that alow the LED to be turned on when the button is pushed and turned off when the button is pushed again. Here is my code:

```C++
/*
Wes Swanson
11/28/20
Button Toggled LED
This code turns an LED on and off each time you release the button.
*/
int currentbuttonstate; // Variable for the current state of the button (in or out)
int lastbuttonstate; // Variable for the last state of the button (in or out)
int LEDval; // Variable to store the read value
int LEDpin = 2; // variable for the LED connected to digital pin 2
int inpin = 12; // variable for the pushbutton connected to digital pin 12

void setup(){
  pinMode(LEDpin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(inpin, INPUT);
}

void loop(){
LEDval = digitalRead(LEDpin); reads the input pin
currentbuttonstate = digitalRead(inpin);
if(currentbuttonstate == LOW && lastbuttonstate == HIGH && LEDval == LOW){
digitalWrite(LEDpin, HIGH);
}
if(currentbuttonstate == LOW && lastbuttonstate == HIGH && LEDval == HIGH){
  digitalWrite(LEDpin, LOW);
}
lastbuttonstate = currentbuttonstate;
}
```

This image is from Mr. Helmsteter. It's the same wiring as last time.

### Reflection

In this assignment I had to use variables in a way I hadn't used them before--To have the past value of something and the current value of it. I had to know if the button had just been released, not if it was in or out, so I needed to find out when it was just pushed in, but was now back to normal. I used one variable (currentbuttonstate) that would be set equal to whatever digitalRead() found out about the button (HIGH or LOW), and another (lastbuttonstate) that would be set equal to currentbuttonstate at the end of the cycle before currentbuttonstate was changed. Then, I used two conditional statements in the middle of the cycle to turn the light on if the button had just been released and the light was off, and to turn the light off if the button had just been released and the light was on. I also learned to use && to mean and, meaning both things had to be true for the statement to be true. This assignment was really fun and I think I can do a lot more things with my arduino now that I've learned these skills.

# TwoButtonsTwoLEDs

### Description & Code

This assignment was to create two button activated LEDs on the same board. It was just doubling my code and wiring from last time, but it was more complex and there was more room to make mistakes. Here is my code:

```C++
/*
  Wes Swanson
  11/27/20
  Button Activated LED
  This code Makes an LED blink when you hold down a button.
*/
int ledPin = 8;  // variable for the LED connected to digital pin 8
int inPin = 2;    // variable for the pushbutton connected to digital pin 2
int val = 0;      // variable to store the read value
int ledPin2 = 12;  // variable for the LED connected to digital pin 12
int inPin2 = 4;    // variable for the pushbutton connected to digital pin 4
int val2 = 0;      // variable to store the read value

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);  // sets the digital pin 8 as output
  pinMode(inPin, INPUT);    // sets the digital pin 2 as input
  pinMode(ledPin2, OUTPUT);  // sets the digital pin 12 as output
  pinMode(inPin2, INPUT);    // sets the digital pin 4 as input
}

void loop() {
  val = digitalRead(inPin);   // reads the input pin
  if (val == HIGH) { // if the button is pushed in, the LED blinks
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    delay(250);
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    delay(250);
  }
  val2 = digitalRead(inPin2);   // reads the 2nd input pin
  if (val2 == HIGH) { // if the 2nd button is pushed in, the 2nd LED blinks
    digitalWrite(ledPin2, HIGH);
    delay(250);
    digitalWrite(ledPin2, LOW);
    delay(250);
  }
}
```

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively easy, but I did get stuck in a few places. After realizing I didn't have any wires in my box and picking them up at school, I was able to follow the steps on the website linked under "image or wiring" to get the wiring right. Remember which sides of the button are connected, and which sides are separated when you set up the wiring. After I figured that out, I just copied and pasted each section of my code from [ButtonActivatedLED](#ButtonActivatedLED) and changed the variables to write the code above.

## TwoButtonServoControl

### Description & Code

```C++
/*
Wes Swanson
Two Button Servo Control
This makes the servo turn from 90 to 0 degrees and back if one button is pressed and turn from 90 to 180 degrees and back if the other button is pressed. The serial monitor will also display which button is pressed. The buttons "toggle" the servo, so every time the button is pressed in it should turn, and it won't work if you hold the buttons in.
*/
// Include the Servo library
#include <Servo.h>
// Declare the Servo pin
int servoPin = 3;
// Create a servo object
Servo myServo;
int buttonstate1 = LOW;
int lastbuttonstate1 = LOW;
int buttonstate2 = LOW;
int lastbuttonstate2 = LOW;
int buttonin1 = 12;
int buttonin2 = 8;
void setup() {
  // We need to attach the servo to the used pin number
  myServo.attach(servoPin);
  pinMode(buttonin1, INPUT);
  pinMode(buttonin2, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop() {
  buttonstate1 = digitalRead(buttonin1);
  buttonstate2 = digitalRead(buttonin2);

  if (buttonstate1 == HIGH && lastbuttonstate1 == LOW) {
    Serial.println("button 1 was pushed");
    // Make servo go to 180 degrees
    myServo.write(180);
    delay(250);
    // Make servo go to 90 degrees
    myServo.write(90);
  }
  if (buttonstate2 == HIGH && lastbuttonstate2 == LOW) {
    Serial.println("button 2 was pushed");
    // Make servo go to 0 degrees
    myServo.write(0);
    delay(250);
    // Make servo go to 90 degrees
    myServo.write(90);
  }
  lastbuttonstate1 = buttonstate1;
  lastbuttonstate2 = buttonstate2;
}
```
